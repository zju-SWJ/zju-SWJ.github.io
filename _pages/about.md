I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Software Technology, [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University in June 2025, supervised by Prof. [Can Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C63q3HoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Chun Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/chenc).

My research interests include **computer vision** and **knowledge distillation**.
